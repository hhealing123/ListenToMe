## Description
Music is one of crucial element of everyday life, it is one of a way of expressing our emotions and allows us to relate to other people more closely. We spend hours listening to it; however, sometimes we listen to random music without knowing that it is the song that we actually want to listen to - How sad is that? Thankfully there is `ListenToMe`! `ListenToMe` is a music-focused web application that allows you to find your true music taste; you can use it to be more connected to your peers by sharing songs that you like or see what your friends like! `ListenToMe` also allows you to search for songs, add the songs to your profile, as well as allowing you to filter songs or artists based on your music taste. Stay tuned!
